proceedings the guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries the acm digital library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organizations journals magazines newsletters and conference proceedings online services include a forum called ubiquity and tech news digest there is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature this secondary database is a rich discovery service known as the acm guide to computing literature acm adopted a hybrid open access oa publishing model in 2013 authors who do not choose to pay the oa fee must grant acm publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement acm was a green publisher before the term was invented authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the acm digital librarys permanently maintained version of record all metadata in the digital library is open to the world including abstracts linked references and citing works citation and usage statistics as well as all functionality and services other than the free articles the fulltexts are accessed by subscription there is also a mounting challenge to the acms publication practices coming from the open access movement some authors see a centralized peerreview process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arxiv other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online such as journal of artificial intelligence research jair journal of machine learning research jmlr and the journal of research and practice in information technology membership grades in addition to student and regular members acm has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers fellows acm fellow and list of fellows of the association for computing machinery the acm fellows program was established by council of the association for computing machinery in 1993 to recognize and honor outstanding acm members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the acm since march 2015 there are about 958 fellows out of about 75000 professional members distinguished members in 2006 acm began recognizing two additional membership grades one which was called distinguished members distinguished members distinguished engineers distinguished scientists and distinguished educators have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous acm membership and have made a significant impact on the computing field note that in 2006 when the distinguished members first came out one of the three levels was called distinguished member and was changed about two years later to distinguished educator those who already had the distinguished member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles senior members also in 2006 acm began recognizing senior members senior members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous acm membership distinguished speakers while not technically a membership grade the acm recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science a distinguished speaker is appointed for a threeyear period there are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers the acm website describes

False positives and false negatives happen all the time in every government.  Arming the people slightly reduces the false negative rate by permitting insurrection when things get awful.  Obviously that is much rarer than it should be.  It infinitessimally increases the false positive rate - insurrection when things are going ok has been super rare worldwide.  

>Actually not really. I prefer bench trials.

Fair enough, though I strongly disagree.  How about voting?  Should we replace our electorate with a professional group of well-educated technocratic voters who will base their decisions on science instead of popular preferences?

In this budget, we have moved to send out a message that Ireland is still open for business, in spite of the current difficulties that are shared worldwide. We have also refocused our spending within the resources available to us to deliver increases in priority areas, including social welfare, health and education.
My Department and its agencies will play a key role in working through the current economic circumstances and in making sure that we are well positioned to reap the opportunities that will undoubtedly arise when the global situation improves. We will do this by continuing to work to attract foreign direct investment, by helping Irish businesses to develop and grow their exports, by continuing to prioritise investment in science, technology and innovation, and by providing supports to small businesses. We will also continue to invest in upskilling the labour force and ensure that adequate retraining and support services are available for those who have recently lost their jobs.

There's this idea in American culture[^worldwide] that's so pervasive we tend to
accept it as fact:

[^worldwide]:
  As I've traveled the world, I've realized this isn't _just_ an American problem: everywhere I go, I see signs of the [Overkill Cult](/overkill-cult) at work.
  This is also the term used by scientists to describe [the required planetary conditions for sustaining life](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/02oct_goldilocks/), and by the [_Mythbusters_](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/the-goldilocks-zone/) to describe the amount of explosives that's not too underwhelming, but not so overboard that it blows everything to hell.

Surely it will be another date that will live in infamy; no law is needed to ordain that and no law could change it. But September 11 was, and should be, something more. And after the devastation is cleared, new buildings raised up, and commerce and finance return - all critical to the prosperity of New York and the nation, the other great test will be whether we sustain the moral power surge which moved across the city and this country in response to the terrorist attack.   On one of the worst of days, we found the best in each other. Instead of being defined by the terrorists, as they had planned, we defined ourselves. I saw this moral surge manifest itself as our students and neighbors gathered for a vigil in Washington Square Park. One first year law student from rural Georgia told how terrified he was that Tuesday morning, asking himself: \"Why am I here?\" Now he said, as he stood in front of the great arch that marks the square: \"I have seen New York, my classmates, my community. How could I be anywhere else?\"   Amid the outpouring of spirit in the days that followed, we were all rescue workers, saving and affirming our humanity. Tens of thousands contributed their food, their money, their sweat, and their blood. Volunteers in record numbers were frustrated by their inability to do more. We all saw clearly the commitment of our police and firefighters, and we came to view them differently than we ever had before. Confounding past enmities even as he confirmed the strength of his leadership, Mayor Giuliani became a unifier and healer. We all reached out; we comforted; in the face of so much death, we gave a new and unforgettable life to the idea of community.   But the moral surge could recede, just as the good feeling during the blackouts of the past faded after the lights came back on. If so, the commemorations of September 11 would become just rituals of remembrance, the rebuilding just business as usual. So in the end, rebuilding structures is not enough; we have to build a renewed spirit of New York based on our values of freedom and tolerance, our vision of a diverse, open society - the true targets the terrorists were trying to destroy.   Each of us has a part to play. Universities like ours can and will provide scholarships for the children of the victims. We can and will create chronicles of this singular moment, to capture not just the horror, but also the affirmation that rose from the ashes. We can and will send witnesses, teams of students and faculty, into schools and communities across the country, sharing what they saw and felt here, and striving to convert the spirit of the moment into the spirit of an era.   But I also believe that whatever any of us does separately, all of us have to ask what we can do together in this transformative time. We are at a moral crossroads, and universities have a singular responsibility to shape the ideas that matter and to advance the creation of the future. As a first step, we at NYU will ask other universities and institutions to join with us this fall in convening a summit of cultural, financial, political, religious, and educational leaders. The purpose will be to begin an ongoing process, not just to rebuild physically, but to sustain and strengthen the moral surge. It is easy to celebrate the extraordinary response to this crisis. The real challenge is to make the unforgettable sense of community after September 11 more than a memory or a moment in time, but the new ground of our common being. Just as we may have a worldwide architectural competition to re-build ground zero, so we must build on the moral underpinnings which the people of New York have shown the world since the attack.   We are the world's first city, not just America's. And the world is ready to hear from us, to respond, to join us in renewal. A French newspaper proclaims: \"We are all New Yorkers.\" The Mayor of Rome offers to withdraw that city's bid for the 2012 Olympics in favor of New York, so the games can open in the sight of the Statue of Liberty as a global expression of solidarity.   Societies live by stories. On September 11, the page turned and now we have to write a new chapter. We must make it the story of a continuing moral surge - and of a New York that truly will be the world's \"shining city on a hill\".

[{"id":"comment-210290","author":"hugh_farey","post":"We all refine our opinions with age, I guess. In my article (2014) I mentioned Marcia Boi’s 2010 opinions, but not, unsurprisingly, her 2015 ideas. In 2010, apart from spotting what she thought were a few misidentifications, she was mostly concerned with what the presence of all those species might signify in terms of funeral rites, and not at all dismissive of Frei’s findings. This year, she is much more critical. Frei’s studies are ” wildly inaccurate”, his pollen was “forcibly made to match a probable geographic origin”, and his conclusions are “partial and ambiguous.” One after another, even after giving it initial credence, anybody who examines the pollen data finds it too anomalous to be acceptable as any kind of evidence. Daveb makes an interesting comment. “We end up with yet another unsatisfactory situation, apparently having put all our trust in those with a claim to know the science, but apparently who knew a lot less than they thought they did.” Without wishing to be dismissive, this is the attitude of many authenticists, whose uncritical acceptance of anything which supports their belief (and, with Mc Crone in mind, an uncritical rejection of anything which doesn’t) has led them to come a cropper when discrepancies and uncertainties are pointed out. Eventually, I truly believe, a general consensus for authenticity or otherwise will be established, on the basis of new data, or old data reinterpreted, but simply putting all ones trust in “scientists”, without carefully evaluating their work for ones self, is not the way to do it..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"12:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210312","author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, of course it wouldn’t be fair. You’re back to clinging to putting all your trust in ‘experts’ who must be right rather than looking at their data for yourself. I know absolutely nothing about pollen that I haven’t read on the internet in the last three years or so and have never been asked to do anything in a criminal case. So what? Does that mean I’m wrong? Try me. Did Frei use a light pressure or a heavy one? Did he fold his tapes on themselves or not? Did he accurately identify 58 species of plant? Did he compare his samples with “botanical gardens worldwide renowned for their collections”? Are any of the contradictions and obscurities I pointed out in my article untrue? If so, name one. Or is everything I say to be ignored because I haven’t testified in a trial? He was commissioned to investigate the plane crash when Dag Hammarskjold was killed. Yes indeed. He attempted to do this by melting down as much of the airframe as he could, weighing it, and examining it for traces of bullets or bombs. He concluded that one could “exclude the possibility of hostile actions from the air or from the ground” and that there was “no room for the suggestion of sabotage”. His conclusions were challenged immediately, and the possibility of sabotage was, and continues to be, investigated..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210275","author":"hugh_farey","post":"No; no part of the Shroud has been “analyzed down to the quantum level.” Hardly anything has. While it is true that everything is made of atoms, and that the interior of atoms operate according to the rules of quantum physics, it is certainly not true that any of the experiments on the Shroud depended on any knowledge of any of it. The Soret band was discovered and explained by Jacques Louis Soret in 1883, and does not require any quantum analysis to be useful. To the layman, there does not seem to be much difference in scale between ‘a small speck’ and an electron, such that one can say “To me that’s down to the quantum level,” but the difference is similar to that between the solar system and a football..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"7:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210277","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Understood, Carlos, but actually thistle pollen is much the same whatever the genus, and anyway it now seems that the “Gundelia” pollen was misidentified even at genus level.

After establishing that the pollen in question is not able to be identified at the species level, and that it better resembles pollen from the genus Carduus than the genus Gundelia, Jones leaps to the quite unwarranted identification of the pollen as from the species Carduus argentatus, which, he says “grows around Jerusalem”, and is more attractive than Gundelia anyway. Actually Carduus argentatus is widespread from Spain to Afghanistan, and the Carduus genus generally consists of nearly 100 species distributed all over Eurasia and Africa. Why Carduus argentatus would be a more attractive funeral decoration than Gundelia tournefortii escapes me. Although its leaves are less spiky than Gundelia, it is still a very awkward plant to handle, and its flower, a single typical purple thistle flower, is not at all as pretty as Gundelia, a round head of lots of tiny yellow inflorescences..","date":"2015-09-14","mins":"3:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210442","author":"hugh_farey","post":"There may, of course, be Helichrysum on the Sudarium, but not on the Shroud, especially if neither cloth was originally from Israel.

Fairly arbitrary scoopings of dust mean that these findings are painted with a pretty broad brush, but the concept is precise and a useful analytical tool. Incidentally, for the scientists among our readers, I thoroughly recommend downloading the ‘Supplementary Material’ which can be found after the Acknowledgements, which adds a good deal more information. Of the pollen, of course, only two or three of the two dozen or so species listed in this paper coincide with anything discovered by previous palynologists. Where is the Gundelia which made up a third of the previous assemblages? Where the “continuous carpet” of Matricaria or Anthemis of Avinoam Danin? Where the Carduus, the Helicrysum, or Scheuermann’s Chrysanthemum?

Fanti knows very well that no subsequent pollen analysis, by DNA or SEM or even just looking again at through a microscope, has done anything at all to verify Max Frei’s speculations, so I am surprised that he has claimed that he has “matched the results obtained by Max Frei Sulzer.” The reference you give says nothing about pollen or Max Frei..","date":"2015-11-06","mins":"3:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/05/paper-chase-new-paper-on-sem-analysis-of-pollen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  New Paper on SEM Analysis of Pollen"},{"id":"comment-214327","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I do apologise, Louis.

I note with suspicion that Lucotte’s identifications are based on “the Rossignol palynothèque, specially devoted to Near East pollens” and that “Palestinian pollen grains produced by trees and tree like shrubs are described by Horowitz & Baum.” A more balanced study would not have assumed that the pollen was Middle Eastern from the start.
